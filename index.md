## about

<p align="justify"> Economist, Novelist, Poet. </p>

<p> My primary research interests lie in microeconomic theory, information economics, and machine learning. 
I am interested in both pure theory and applied questions, employing techniques from economics, mathematics and machine learning. </p>

<p> BSc. Mathematical Economics and Statistics (Class I, cum laude), University of Birmingham, 2019.</p>
<p> BSc. Economics with minor in Finance, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, 2019.  </p>

<p> TA, Linear Algebra/Complex Analysis/Probability and Statistics, Guilin University Of Aerospace Technology. </p>

<p> Confronted with reproducibility crisis in one of my dissertations, I took a gap year to systematically rebuild my trust in Economics after my graduation in 2019.  </p>
