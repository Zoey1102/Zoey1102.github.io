## about

<p align="justify"> Econ student, Writer, Philosophy lover, aspirational future econometrist with firm conviction in data integrity. </p>

<!--
<p> My primary research interests lie in microeconomic theory, information economics, and machine learning. 
I am interested in both pure theory and applied questions, employing techniques from economics, mathematics and machine learning. </p>
-->
<p> I got BSc. Mathematical Economics and Statistics from  University of Birmingham(UK) and BSc. Economics with minor in Finance from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics(China).  </p>

<p> I encountered reproducibility crisis in 2019: when writing one of my two dissertations that evaluated the efficiency of Chinese carbon trading, I found all significant results from collected literature irreproducible. Soon I realised that I must systematically reconstruct my belief in Economics before moving on to pursue a PhD. After field work with people in the industry and contact with scholars in environmental economics and policy, I finally gathered enough courage to tell a story behind insignificance. Insignificance is insignificance. A real Economist is never ever a "stargazer". </p>

<p> What am I doing during the second gap year?
  Teaching Assistant in Linear Algebra/Complex Analysis/Probability & Statistics at a University in China. 
  Data Quality Analyst Intern for China Household Finance Survey about COV-19's impact. </p>
