## about

<p align="justify"> Economist, Writer, gadgets and doodads addict. </p>

<!--
<p> My primary research interests lie in microeconomic theory, information economics, and machine learning. 
I am interested in both pure theory and applied questions, employing techniques from economics, mathematics and machine learning. </p>
-->
<p> I got BSc. Mathematical Economics and Statistics from  University of Birmingham(UK) and BSc. Economics with minor in Finance from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics(China).  </p>

<p> Firm maintainer of Data Integrity: In 2019, when writing my dissertation on pilot carbon trading at China, I found all significant results from collected literature irreproducible. To solve the reproducibility crisis, I am now taking a gap year to systematically rebuild my belief in Economics after graduation. After field work and interview with people in the industry and contact with scholars in environmental economics and polocy, I finally gathered courage to declare insignificance and tell the story of insignificance. Insignificance is insignificance. Do NOT aim at becoming a "stargazer". </p>

<p> TA, Linear Algebra/Complex Analysis/Probability and Statistics, Guilin University Of Aerospace Technology. </p>
