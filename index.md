## about

<p align="justify"> Econ graduate, Writer, Philosophy lover. <br>
Aspirational future econometrist with firm conviction in data integrity. </p>

<p> I am primarily interested by microeconomic theory, empirical political economy, social and economic networks. 
Always want to weave study of economic thought history into reality-focused empirical research. </p>

<p> I got BSc. Mathematical Economics and Statistics(summa cum laude) from  University of Birmingham(UK) and BSc. Economics with minor in Finance from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics(China).  </p>

<p> I encountered reproducibility crisis in 2019: when writing one of my two dissertations that evaluated the efficiency of Chinese carbon trading, I found all significant results from collected literature irreproducible. Soon I realised that I must systematically reconstruct my belief in Economics before moving on to pursue a PhD. After field work with people in the industry and contact with scholars in environmental economics and policy, now I am confident enough to tell a story behind insignificance. </p>

<p>Insignificance is insignificance. A real Economist is never ever a "stargazer".</p>
